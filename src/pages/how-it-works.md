# How This Site Works

Welcome to the technical overview of my site! This page explains the architecture and future plans.

## Current Architecture

This site is built using a custom static site generator that:
1. Converts Markdown content to HTML
2. Applies consistent templates and styling
3. Generates a fast, lightweight static site

### Key Components

- **Content:** Written in Markdown with YAML front matter

### 3. Content Distribution
